          <strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected.

          <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies
          to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different

        </li>
        <li class="tribute-ul-list">
          <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
        </li>
        <li class="tribute-ul-list">
          <strong>1951</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
          creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li class="tribute-ul-list">
          <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent

          <strong>2005</strong>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
          modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are
          not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long
          before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li class="tribute-ul-list">
          <strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.
